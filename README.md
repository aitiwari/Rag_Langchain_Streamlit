# Langchain_RAG_Streamlit
Description:

This repository showcases a Streamlit application that leverages the power of LangChain to implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). This approach combines:

LangChain: A versatile framework for orchestrating large language models (LLMs) and vector databases. It facilitates the integration of these components for advanced NLP tasks.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): A technique that enhances LLM outputs by retrieving relevant information from a document store (powered by a vector database) before feeding it to the LLM for generation.

# Version
python-version : 3.11.9
